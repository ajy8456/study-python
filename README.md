# study-python

This repo was made for a study to use python fluently.

## Installing dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # --user
python -m ipykernel install --user --name study-python # conneting the kernel / 'study-python' is the name of the virtual environment
```

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for this case.
