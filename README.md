# study-python

This repo was made for a study to use python fluently.

## Installing dependencies

With `pip` after installing `python>=3.7`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # --user
```

With `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge -r requirements.txt # |NOTE| need to be tested
```

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for this case.
